# Flight Management Dashboard

A flight management dashboard built with **React** and **Next.js**, enabling users to view and update flight statuses in real-time, along with filtering and management features.

## Features

- **Flight List**: Displays a table with flight information like flight number, origin, destination, status, and departure time.
- **Filter Flights**: Filter flights by flight number, origin, destination, and status (e.g., Scheduled, Delayed, Cancelled, In-flight).
- **Real-Time Status Update**: Updates flight status dynamically with real-time updates when the user changes a flight's status.
- **Authentication**: Secure login mechanism using JWT tokens to authenticate users and restrict access to the dashboard.
- **Logout Functionality**: Users can log out, which will remove the JWT token and redirect them to the login page.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Frontend framework for building the user interface.
- **Next.js**: Full-stack framework with server-side rendering (SSR) and API routes for data management.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing flight details.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for fast and responsive UI development.
- **JWT Authentication**: JSON Web Tokens for handling secure user authentication.
- **REST API**: Routes to manage CRUD operations for flights and flight status updates.

## How to Use Filtering Flights
On the Dashboard page, you can filter flights based on various criteria:

1. Flight Number
- Search flights by the flight number.
2. Origin
-  Filter by the departure city/airport.
3. Destination
-  Filter by the arrival city/airport.
4. Status
-  Filter by the flight's current status, such as Scheduled, Delayed, Cancelled, or In-flight.
5. Airline
- Filter by Airline.
6.  Type
- Filter by Type of Flight.
8. Update Flight Status
- To update a flightâ€™s status: (NOTE APPLICABLE FOR USER WITH admin ROLE for regular USER, Showing list of flights)

## Select a flight row from the table.
A modal will appear allowing you to update the flight status.
Once a status is selected and confirmed, the table will refresh automatically with the updated status for the selected flight.

## Logout
To log out of the application:

## Click on the "Logout" button in the header, which will clear the JWT token from localStorage and redirect you to the login page.
